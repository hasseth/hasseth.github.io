# My First Post (Hello, World)

This is my first post.  Maybe it stays forever, maybe it doesn't. The important thing is that it is here now. I have a lot to learn about markdown.

##Seconday Heading
That right there should have been a secondary heading.  Let's check by clicking the "Preview" button.

Nope.  I think I need a space first.
## Secondary Heading

When started typing after the space, everything was bolded.  I'd call that a good sign, right?  Lets check again.

Yep, that did it.

Now the tutorial (from [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/)) is telling me to delete the post they put in the template I'm using.  It should be gone soon.

Also, they talk about images again.  Lets try an image of that preview button I was talking about earlier.

![preview button](/images/preview_button.png)

By the way, while writing this post, I learned a couple of things about uploading images.  The instructions I'm following said I should be able to just type "images/preview_button.png" to add an image.  I had to write "/images/preview_button.png", though.  I think this is because I needed to go back a level from the location of this post in the github directory to get to the image folder where that was stored.  I guess that means links are relative to what I'm working on, rather than to the parent directory.  That's fine.  I also learned that putting a space in the filename made my image not display properly.  I coudlnt' figure out how to change the filename in github, so I just had to delete it and re-upload with an underscore.  It seems to be working now, but I'm not sure what I "learned" is entirely true.  Time will tell.
