Hello and welcome to this blog. If you found this, how did you find this? At the time of writing, I don't even know if you can tell me that, because this is a really, really early attempt at blogging that follows a simple template provided by [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai), and they haven't mentioned comments yet.  Perhaps they will by the end of the lesson.

Anyways, they recommend including an image. Edit the `index.md` file to change this content. All pages on the blog, including this one, use [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). You can include images:

## This is a title

And you can include links, like this [link to fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai). Posts will appear after this file.
