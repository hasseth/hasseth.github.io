# This is a markdown heading I think!

Hello and welcome to this blog. If you found this, how did you find this? At the time of writing, I don't even know if you can tell me that, because this is a really, really early attempt at blogging that follows a simple template provided by [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai), and they haven't mentioned comments yet.  Perhaps they will by the end of the lesson.

Anyways, they recommend including an image. I have changed their example to the the cat image that I just committed.

Hopefully that displays at least some understanding of the concept.

## What am I doing here?

Trying to learn coding.  All of it. But actually mostly data analysis, including deep learning from fast.ai.  So far their system seems pretty cool. I created a few predictive models (accidentally almost wrong "algorithms", but the point of this blog it to learn, so I might as well train myself on using the correct terminology) in the same way a that a toddler "baked cookies" when their mom let them stir the batter for a few minutes.  Despite the simplicity of the models and my personal lack of understanding of how it all works, being able to see it run was somewhat thrilling and encouraging.  I like the teaching approach used.

Anyways, I am going to continue with the lesson now, and hopefully soon post a working piece of something.  I think I have most of the information I need to create a model that can identify nuts, bolts, screws, and other junk that's in my fastener drawer.  If I can, I'd like to make that run here and eventually on a raspberry pi.  Then I could figure out how to make a robot arm separate them.  That's the dream at least.  We will see how it goes...
